# Mean escape times

This is the code connected to a Master thesis at the University of Oxford. The project
centered around an experiment with e-puck robots, and this repository contains some
of the connected code and instruction to replicate the experiment.

## Getting Started

The file structure of this repository is as follows. The folders  ``matlab-files'' and
``auxilary'' files contain files not directly relevant for the programming of the robots,
while everything else just concerns the robots programming.
The former folder contains some files regarding data retrieval and calibration,
while the latter contains miscellaneous.  

### Prerequisites

Most of the relevant knowledge to setup the e-puck robots may be found in the
[GCtronic Wiki](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/E-Puck).

Specifically, in addition to the project file above the following is needed:
* [MPLAB X IDE](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide): This integrated developer environment (IDE)
  combines the necessary libraries and compiles the firmware for the robots.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
